# Survive the Semester

A C++ game project developed as part of an **ECS (Entity Component System) programming course**
at MTA. The game is a Breakout-style arcade game themed around surviving a university semester.
The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball at course bricks, catch assignment drops, survive
exams, and maintain a passing average — all before the academic years run out.

## Built With

| Technology | Role |
|------------|------|
| **C++20** | Primary language |
| **BAGEL** (`bagel.h`) | Custom header-only ECS framework |
| **SDL3** | Window, renderer, input |
| **SDL3_image** | Spritesheet loading |
| **Box2D 3.x** | 2D physics (collision, kinematic bodies) |
| **CMake** | Build system |

---

## Gameplay

See [GAME_RULES.md](GAME_RULES.md) for the full rules.

**Short version:** clear all 21 course bricks across 5 academic years. Each brick has a progress
meter filled by ball hits and caught assignment drops. When a course reaches 100%, an exam starts.
Survive the exam, earn a grade, and keep your average above 60 to graduate.
Once all courses are cleared, a Graduation stage begins — navigate a student character across
a chair-filled auditorium to reach the stage.

## Architecture

The project uses a **Data-Oriented Design (DOD)** approach via the BAGEL ECS:

- **Entities** are plain IDs (`ent_type`) with no data or logic.
- **Components** are pure POD structs (e.g., `Position`, `Course`, `GameState`).
- **Systems** are stateless free functions that iterate over component queries.
- **Cross-system communication** uses **event entities** — short-lived entities carrying a single
  event component, created by producers and consumed by other systems within the same frame,
  then deleted by `eventCleanupSystem`.

No virtual functions, no STL containers, no shared/unique pointers. All physics is encapsulated
behind `Physics.h` — other systems never call Box2D directly.

### System Execution Order (per frame)

```
inputSystem
physicsStepSystem(dt)       ← Box2D step + Position sync
contactEventSystem          ← contacts → CourseHit / HazardTriggered / DropCaught events
brickMeterSystem            ← hit responses, drop spawning
brickClearDelaySystem       ← timed brick destruction
courseHitSystem             ← paddle bounce, ball loss
dropSystem(dt)              ← remove fallen drops
brickUnlockSystem           ← prerequisite checking
courseProgressSystem        ← course state, ExamStarted trigger
examSystem(dt)              ← exam timer, projectiles, ExamFinished
hazardSystem                ← spawn and apply hazard effects
yearSystem                  ← year timer, totalTime accumulation, year advancement
gameStateSystem             ← life/tax/exam → win/lose logic
eventCleanupSystem          ← delete all event entities
deadCleanupSystem           ← destroy physics bodies + delete Dead entities
renderSystem                ← draw all Drawable entities
hudSystem                   ← lives, year, elapsed timer, status line, pause overlay
```

> **Note:** During pause (`gs.paused == true`) the main loop skips `tick()` entirely —
> all simulation systems are frozen including timers.
